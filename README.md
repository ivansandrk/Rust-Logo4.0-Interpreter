# Rust Logo Interpreter

![PC Logo 4.0](res/logo.png)

Interpreter for PC Logo 4.0 written in Rust. My first contact with programming was at the age of 12 when at school we got introduced to Logo and I immediately took a strong liking to it. You write the instructions for the computer, and the computer does them exactly as told. How genius is that!

## Quick start

Clone the repository and run the program with `cargo run`.

## Examples

You can run the example programs.

TODO: Example program foo (+image).

TODO: Example program bar (+image).

TODO: Example program baz (+image).
