# Rust Logo Interpreter

<img src="res/logo.png" alt="PC Logo 4.0" width="640"/>

Interpreter for PC Logo 4.0 written in Rust. My first contact with programming was at the age of 12 when at school we got introduced to Logo and I immediately took a strong liking to it. You write the instructions for the computer, and the computer does them exactly as told. How genius is that!

## Quick start

Clone the repository and run the program with `cargo run`.

## Examples

You can run the example programs. Load the examples with:

`LOAD "LOGO\-EXAMPLES\/IVAN.LGO`.
